# Week 5a: JavaScript Ecology: Libraries, Packages, & Modules
**Saeko Ehara**

**Work: SINK/SENSE**

**Why she is post-digital (based on Florian Cramer)?**

According to Cramer, post - digital art doesn't reject digital tools - it operates after the novelty has worn off. It's messy, hybrid, physical, and conceptually rich. Saeko Ehara's installations:

> Use digital media to explore materiality, decay, ephemerality, and bodily experience.

> Blur boundaries between organic and synthetic, echoing themes of de-familirization 

> Rely on glitch aesthetics, data feedback, or custom interfaces - but not to show off technology. The digital is just one medium in a larger ecosystem.

**Technology Used:**

> Sensors

> Arduino, Raspberry Pi

> Video projection, real-time input/output systems

> Custom code 

**She could use:**

> **p5.js** - for real - time generative visuals 

> **Tone.js** - for ambient/reactive sound

> **ml5.js** - for real - time classification 

> **Web serial API** - to read sensors via Arduino 

> **Three.js** - for spatial/matrix-like 3D compositions

> **Rita.js** - for generating poetic or glitched language overlays
