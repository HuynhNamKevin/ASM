# Week 5a: JavaScript Ecology: Libraries, Packages, & Modules
**Saeko Ehara**

**Work: SINK/SENSE**

**Why she is post-digital (based on Florian Cramer)?**

According to Cramer, post - digital art doesn't reject digital tools - it operates after the novelty has worn off. It's messy, hybrid, physical, and conceptually rich. Saeko Ehara's installations:

> Use digital media to explore materiality, decay, ephemerality, and bodily experience.

> Blur boundaries between organic and synthetic, echoing themes of de-familirization 

> Rely on glitch aesthetics, data feedback, or custom interfaces - but not to show off technology. The digital is just one medium in a larger ecosystem.
