# Week 2a: Cute as Aesthetic Register

**Lectuere**

 **Definition of an aesthetic register:** is a way we categorize styles or feelings in visual culture.

 **Some other aesthetic registers:**
  > Gothic is dark and moody 

  > Minimalist is clean and simple 

  > And cute is playful, soft, and emotionally engaging   

 **What characterises the cute?:** often involves: softness, bright color, or sweetness

 **The relation between cute & power:** The cute can disarm us or make us want to protect it -- that's a kind of emotional influence.

 **The relation between cute & coomodification:** Cute things are easy to sell. They're turned into products, icons, and merchandise.

 **The relation between cute & platform capitalism:** Apps and social media often use cute design to keep users engaged (and scrolling).

 **The relation between cute & artificial intelligence:** Some AI assistants and robots are made to look or sound cute so we trust them more

**Homework**

**Cute visuals:**

For the visual side, I want to use: 

    > Bright colors 

    > Round, bouncy shapes

For the cute sounds, like: 

    > Boop! when you click 

    > Pop! when somethings appears or disappears

    > Tada! when you complete an action 

For the cute interactions

    > Waving when you hover 

    > Jumping when click 

**AT1 Project: Mood Garden**

**Concept:**
In Mood Garden, users can interact with a calming music garden. Each interaction add cuteness and mood:

 > Click: plant flower

 > Drag: draw trail after the flower

 > Keys: Change the background between 3 moods

Cuteness: 
 > Visuals: Warm color palette, flowers

 > Sounds: Calm background music, sound of ground and grass

 > Interactions: Smooth
