# Week 1a
**Lectuere**
 For the first class, I can not join at the first day becasue I was clashed with the other class. But when I allocated successfully, I checked on the Canvas so I can got clearly what studied on the first day of this class related to creating blog for write what we learned and homework task. Beside that, I got p5js as the main code language in this semester '[text](https://editor.p5js.org/)' and watch the Youtube playlist from "The Coding Train" '[text](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)'. In addition, got how p5 work and how to write blog and push on github, which I didn't get clearly how it work.
**Homework**
1. <iframe id="grid homework 1" src="https://editor.p5js.org/huynhnamkevin123/full/XgmPtoPvV"></iframe>
For this homework, I saw it just a horizontally loop, so I created a vertically loop to make a grid, that means we need one loop for columns and one loop for rows.

2. for the work by Rafael Rozendaal, I chose the work "Blocks" '[text](https://www.newrafael.com/blocks/)'
Describe: 
_ The screen is filled with colorful rectangular blocks.
_ Each block is a solid color.
_ When refresh the page, it will randomly show another color.
_ Same the layout but different colors.
List of concepts: 
_ "rect()" to draw rectangles 
_ "fill()" to apply colors for each blocks
_ "random()" to set random colors 
_ "array" to store the color of each block 
List of references:
