# Week 1a: Intro to Creative Coding

**Lectuere**
 For the first class, I can not join at the first day becasue I was clashed with the other class. But when I allocated successfully, I checked on the Canvas so I can got clearly what studied on the first day of this class related to creating blog for write what we learned and homework task. Beside that, I got p5js as the main code language in this semester '[p5js](https://editor.p5js.org/)' and watch the Youtube playlist from "The Coding Train" '[The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)'. In addition, got how p5 work and how to write blog and push on github, which I didn't get clearly how it work.

**Homework**
1. <iframe id="grid homework" src="https://editor.p5js.org/huynhnamkevin123/full/XgmPtoPvV"></iframe>
<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`grid homework`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 

</script>

For this homework, I saw it just a horizontally loop, so I created a vertically loop to make a grid, that means we need one loop for columns and one loop for rows.
2. for the work by Rafael Rozendaal, I chose the work "Blocks" '[text](https://www.newrafael.com/blocks/)'

Describe: 

_ The screen is filled with colorful rectangular blocks.

_ Each block is a solid color.

_ When refresh the page, it will randomly show another color.

_ Same the layout but different colors.

List of concepts: 

_ "rect()" to draw rectangles 

_ "fill()" to apply colors for each blocks

_ "random()" to set random colors 

_ "array" to store the color of each block 

List of references:

_ '[fill](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/fill/)'

_ '[for](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/for/)'

_ '[random](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/random/)'
