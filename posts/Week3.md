# Week 3a: Images, Sound & Interaction

**Lecture** 

**Functions & Classes**

**Functions**

. are like recipes 

. **defining** a function = writing a recipe 

. **calling** a function = making the cake 

. side effects are when functions change things outside their scope:

    > quick and easy 

    > can get very messy 

. functions have inputs and outputs:
    > **arguments** = inputs

    > **return** = outputs
