# Week 12: ... in the Applied Critical Posthumanities

Creative coding -- the practivce of using code for creative expression -- has always stood at the intersection of art, technology, and experimentation. Yet, one question remains critical: **Should inclusion be a core, structure pillar of creative coding?**

My answer is yes -- and this post explores why, drawing on sociotechnical concepts that exposes the invisible boundaries and possibilities within digital culture. 

**Digital Infrastructure & Technology-Generating Capacity**

Access to digital infrastructure directly determines who can participate in creative coding. Those without fast internet, powerful hardware, or up-to-date software are locked out. Even more so, the capacity to generate new tools or adapt existing frameworks -- not just consume them -- is still concentrated in the hands of the few. For inclusion to be strctural, we must ensure equitable access to build, not just to use. 

**Intrinsic / Extrinsic motivations for learning**

> *Intrinsic: curiosity, self-expression, joy of exploration* 

> *Extrinsic: career, status, institutional requirements*

An inclusive creative coding spaces values both. We must resist systems that only validate instituional, perfomance-based learning -- otherwise, self-taught artists or neurodivergent learners may be excluded from recognition and support. 

**Computer Science Gatekeeping**

Much of creative coding relies on foundational computer science knowledge - yet gatekeeping persists through academic jargon, opaque documentation, and elitist community norms. Inclusion means redefining expertise and valuing different types of contributions: glitch art, messy code, visual-first approaches, or live-coding perfomances. These are valid, even if they don't follow traditional CS structures. 

**Digital Literacy & Legislation**

Without widespread digital literacy, creative coding risks becoming a niche accessible only to the already-skilled. Furthermore, legal frameworks can disempower creators in marginalized communities who lack legal support or knowledge. Inclusion must go hand-in-hand with education and digital right advocacy.

**Techno-Feudalism & Vectoralist Oppresion**

Inclusion is hindered by what McKenzie Wark calls vectoralism -- where information is controlled by platforms, not creators. Creative coding environments are increasingly mediated by proprietary software(Adobe, Unity, etc), creating techno-feudalist systems where access = subscription. Inclusive practice must support open-source tools and resist platform lock-in. 

**Network Effects, Switching Costs & Interoperability**

Communities often coalesce around specific tools (Processing, p5.js, TouchDesigner). These create network effects -- the more people use it, the more value it has. But this also creates switching costs: if you don't use the dominant tool, you're out. Inclusion means reducing friction between platforms through interoperability, and encouraging bridges rather than silos. 

**Extra-institutional hubs of knowledge / the critical posthumanities**

Creatice coding is enriched by extra-institutional hubs: Discord servers, forums, independent workshops. These spaces often prioritize inclusion more than academic does. They embody a posthuman ethos -- embracing ditributed creativity beyond the traditional individual genius model. Inclusion here means making room for collaborative, decentralized growth.
