# Week 7a: Web Audio API & Responding to Text

chaos doesn't mean noise for the sake of noise. It's about organic unpredictability - non-linear, layered, responsive

**Structure:** In your piece, structure comes from spore interaction rules and timed signal bursts. Sonically, this can mirror through layered background ambience that pulse or modulates. 

**Noise:** In nature, fungi produce no sound, but if translated, their thoughts may resemble static, tension, feedback, or granular noise. That's noise with intent, not music.

**Voice:** any voice isn't human or animal - it's emergent.

**De-familiarisation**

Use

**MyNoise:** Use as environmental grounding but warp the EQ/frequencies in real time to mimic fungi' reaction to changes.

**Pink Trombone:** a good example of organic interactivity. Respond to mouse gestures.

**How to kill a zombie:** Excellent for voice distortion or chaos layering. Use similar glitch effects when the fungus "dies" in decay mode.
