# Week 7a: Web Audio API & Responding to Text

chaos doesn't mean noise for the sake of noise. It's about organic unpredictability - non-linear, layered, responsive

**Structure:** In your piece, structure comes from spore interaction rules and timed signal bursts. Sonically, this can mirror through layered background ambience that pulse or modulates. 

**Noise:** In nature, fungi produce no sound, but if translated, their thoughts may resemble static, tension, feedback, or granular noise. That's noise with intent, not music.

**Voice:** any voice isn't human or animal - it's emergent.

**De-familiarisation**

Use 

> recognizable sound sources (water drops, leaves, breathing)

> but modulate them via pitch-shifting, time-stretching, or filtering.

> so they become new fungal entities - eerie but natural 

**MyNoise:** Use as environmental grounding but warp the EQ/frequencies in real time to mimic fungi' reaction to changes.

**Pink Trombone:** a good example of organic interactivity. Respond to mouse gestures.

**How to kill a zombie:** Excellent for voice distortion or chaos layering. Use similar glitch effects when the fungus "dies" in decay mode. 

# Week 7b: Chaos & Dysfunction - Revisiting Interaction 

**What do you think she means by this?**

Wark constrasts "zany" with "interesting" to suggest that zany art is not polished or neatly thoughtful - it is wild, unpredictable, and refuses to be boxed in. Zany works are chaotic, humorous, and often physically exhausting or overloaded - they push back at limits and embrace failure or absurdity as part of their process. 

**In what ways would you consider the chaotic and the zany to be similar? In what ways are they different?**

*Similarities:*

> Both resist conventional aesthetics (clean, controlled, mimimal)

> Both invite unpredictability and discomfort

> Both challenge control or hierarchy - especially in networked, decentralized systems.

*Differences:*

> Chaotic implies disorder and complexity - especially in networked, decentralized systems. 

> Zany brings in humor, speed, labor, and excess - it often feels "over the top" or frenetic 

> Fungal chaos is more ambient and organic than zany.

**In what ways would you consider your AT2 to be zany?**

> The interactions (clicking, dragging spores) are playful.

> There's some unexpectedness (sound bursts, mode changes).

> It resists polish - embracing trails, noise, glitch 

**What might be some ways to make your AT2 more zany?**

> Add random audio clips 

> Visuals could overreact to user input

> Insert unexpected humor

**Post-digital**

> It exist after the digital turn - blending code, biology, sound, and metaphor

> It's interactive and generative 

> It challenges clean design norms with messiness and ecological thinking

> It blends art, code, theory, and science - crossing disciplines and expectations.
