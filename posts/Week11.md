# Week 11b: Progress Report 

My TouchDesigner Experiment Inspired by The Changing Room 

As part of my response to The Changing Room by Lauren McCarthy, I began developing an interactive TouchDesigner that connects with my community of practive -- creative coders and visual artists who use TouchDesigner.

**Domain**

The domain of this community is real-time generative art and interactive visual programming. Our shared focus is on using tools like Touch Designer to create installations, performances, and visuals that respond to human interactions, and data.

**Repertoire**

The repertoire of the community includes: 

> TouchDesigner networks 

> GLSL shaders 

> OSC/WebSocket integrations 

> Tutorials, demo patches, and shared workflows

In my project, I'm drawing on this repertoire by remixing techniques others have posted and integrating user interaction through OSC - all standard tools for my peers. 

**Values**

This community values: 

**> Experimentation**

**> Knowledge - sharing**

**> Open-ended aesthetics**

**> Live feedback loops**

These values are reflected in my onw process, especially the willingness to release something "unfinished" and let othres influence it.

**Brokering**

I see myself brokering betwwen TouchDesigner users and interactive design students, bridging technical ideas and accessible, artistic expression. I'm also drawing inspiration from Lauren McCarthy's art practice and translating it into language of TouchDesigner.

**Omnidirectional Growth**

Rather than planning linearly, my project expanded in multiple directions at once: the visual logic of the patch, the network layer, the community interaction layer. Like a mycelial network, it grew in response to multiple signals. 

**Accumulative Growth**

I built on prior knowledge from forums, GitHub patches, and tutorials. This was not a clean-state project -- it accumulated ideas organically from the communtiy and my previous sketches. 

**Tranformational Growth**

What began as a technical challenge became a question of participation and authorship: what happens when users actively modify a live artwork? Their influence changes the meaning of the piece - transforming it from a personal expression to a shared experience. 

**Fruiting Body** 

The public deployment - a live interactive installation where the TouchDesigner patch reacts to real-time inputs - is the fruiting body of this creative network. It's the visible expression of hidden, collaborative, rhizomatic processess underneath.
